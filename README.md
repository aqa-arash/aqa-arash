- 👋 Hi, I’m @aqa-arash (Arash Moradian), master of science in mechanical engineering.
- 👀 I’m interested in the use of programming and machince learning in mechanical engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Machine learning. I've passed introductory courses on Fortran, C++ and Matlab at university. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any tasks related to the aforementioned topics. I'm also an avid gamer so I'm in on projects that have anything to do with games :)
- 📫 You can reach me on linkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/

Also, I've recently made this portfolio and I would love to hear your opinion on it. https://arashmoradian.wordpress.com/
